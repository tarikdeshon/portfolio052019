Updated Portfolio Page


Overview

Design

The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:


Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes
Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.



Suggested: Update Portfolio -- Employer Competitive

To receive an "A" on this assignment, you should also meet the following requirements
to ensure your portfolio site will help you be employer competitive.


Competitive Content


At least 5 deployed projects (both of your projects and three homework assignments)

External content:


Update your LinkedIn with the projects you've worked on so far
Update the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem,
how you solved it, and some information about your technical approach
Suggested: refactor some of your code from earlier assignments to make them more readable



If you used cors-anywhere in Project 1, update it to make sure your API calls will work consistently


Use the instructions in update-cors-anywhere/README.md

Test to make sure your deployed site works





Competitive Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a couple guidelines on what that means:


Mobile-first design: you should be proud to pull out your phone and share
your portfolio site with a friend, family member, or someone at a meetup.
Polish: choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
Images: add a meaningful screenshot for each of your projects
